* TODO <2012-04-04 Wed> Write a Scientific Paper about this Program.
* TODO <2012-04-04 Wed> Benchmark this software and compare with others.
* TODO <2012-04-04 Wed> Add Cusomized labels depending on the "profile"
  For example, "Standard/University/High School/Hospital/Bus Station",
  etc.  Also allow to add customized profiles.
* TODO <2012-04-03 Tue> Add Documentation and up to date Help files
* TODO <2012-04-03 Tue> Improve Grid computing support
  The current way of configuring instances of ttg to work concurrently
  is no clear and must be by hand.  We have to improve GUI support and
  customization.
* TODO <2012-04-03 Tue> Read from other format files: FET for example.
  FET have a lot of examples, and could be a good start point to
  perform benchmarking and comparisons between tools.
* TODO <2012-04-03 Tue> Add Reports. See http://lazreport.sourceforge.net/
* TODO [#C] <2012-03-31 Sat> build ttg using pbuilder
  DELAYED: <2012-04-03 Tue>
  I have finished this task, however due to a bug in lazarus/fpc,
  compilation of ttg never finishes. It is difficult to report this
  bug because others programmers might found difficult to reproduce.
* TODO <2012-03-24 Sat> Upload TTG to the ppa
  DEADLINE: <2012-04-01 Sat>
** <2012-04-03 Tue> Delayed: alternatively I have configured
   an ubuntu repository in edisonm.dyndns.org/ubuntu
